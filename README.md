# The ETS2/ATS Mapping Guide
Tutorials and documentation for the SCS software map editor

This project was started by Jack Kelly -- many thanks to Jack for his excellent "Intro to Mapping".  Jack's no longer maintaining it, so I (being an SCS mapping n00b in need of doco) am volunteering to maintain and (I hope) extend it.
