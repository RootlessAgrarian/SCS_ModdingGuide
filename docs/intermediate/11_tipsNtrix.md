## Tips & Tricks for Intermediate Mappers

### The most important tip/trick

Always, the single most instructive thing you can do is to open the game map, teleport to an area you admire, and take a close look at it -- figure out how it was done.  This will expand your skills more than any amount of manual reading!

### copy and paste for efficient editing

If you're re-using a favourite set of objects, you can always instantiate all of them them somewhere -- behind a cutplane for example, so you won't see the clutter in free cam view -- and copy/paste them as needed, instead of having to reselect from the Content Browser or long unwieldy menus.

### brush limitations

Sorry, Brush doesn't work on prefabs.

### use Properties panel features for efficient editing

Be aware of that "Default" button at the bottom of Properties panel.  If you will repeatedly use a certain style of road segment or other object, set it as the Default.  Then when you go into E (extend or add) mode, and select that object type, the Default that you saved will automatically be loaded for use.  You can also save a Properties configuration as a named Preset.  Using these features will speed up your editing significantly.

### Building (series) objects can be tricky

Sometimes Building (series or string) objects don't "fall" properly when you use F6.
