## Decorating Your World

The next step in map building is to decorate your map with convincing details.  We've introduced this topic already with the Properties
of road segments:  we've seen how procedural vegetation can be generated to populate the sides of the road with trees, bushes, flowers, etc; and we've seen how materials can be selected to give the terrain each side of the road a distinctive look (ploughed field, grassland,
desert, etc), as well as to vary the road surface colour and texture.

Now we'll take a closer look at all the cool set-dressing available in the Map Editor.

There are three main object types you'll be using to decorate your map:  Prefabs, Models, and Buildings.

You've already worked with *Prefabs*, in the form of road intersections.  There are quite a few other types of prefab.  In general, any "active" area of the map (a place where you interact with the scenery in some way) is a prefab.  These include gas stations, freight terminals, ferry terminals, sleeping areas, etc.

*Models* are by far the most common object type you'll use when dressing up your bare map.  Models include just about everything:  buildings, trees, parked vehicles, people, bridges, statues, cows, chickens, all kinds of stuff.  Some models are animated;  others are static.

*Buildings* are a curious class which does not, for some reason, only include buildings.  "Buildings" includes items that can be generated along a path, such as extensible fencing and railings, lines of trees for boulevards and wind breaks, etc.
