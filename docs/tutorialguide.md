# Tutorial guide

These tutorials are designed to be completed in order, so please resist the urge to skip ahead to later chapters, you'll likely end up frustrated with an issue that was resolved in an earlier part.

**Note:** Some of these tutorials are very image-heavy.

Below are notes on nomenclature and external tools.

## Game Folders

This guide will refer to two folders used by ETS2/ATS. We'll be calling them the **USER** folder and the **INSTALL** folder.

The **USER** folder is the game folder located in the _Documents_ directory on Windows platforms. This folder contains the _mod_ folder, where we'll place our created maps:

```
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\American Truck Simulator
```

The **INSTALL** folder is the game's main folder, which contains the installed game files and executables. Maps we create will be saved in a subfolder here:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\American Truck Simulator
```

For the sake of brevity, only the paths for Euro Truck Simulator 2 will be repeated in this guide. All instructions are equivalent for both games unless stated otherwise.  It is essential that you understand the roles of these two separate locations.  90 percent of the "I can't save my map" and "I can't (re)load my saved map" questions on the forums are due to confusion about these two locations and what goes where when.

## Tools used

### 7-Zip

  You'll need a ZIP archiving tool that allows you to disable compression in order to create correct .scs archives.

  Most tools will have these options, but these tutorials will demonstrating using [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/). 7-Zip is a powerful and free archiving tool, and a great replacement if you're still using the infamous WinRAR demo.
