# The Mapping Guide

By SecretImbecile (Jack Kelly), forked and extended by RootlessAgrarian (De Clarke)

This guide hopes to become a comprehensive and openly editable collection of resources for the SCS game engine editor, used by _Euro Truck Simulator 2_ and _American Truck Simulator_.  It is very much WIP and changing daily/weekly, sometimes hourly.  Expect to see a lot of stubs and incomplete stuff.  The "Fundamentals" section is almost complete as of Jan 2018.

The last 2 PDFs are from a few years ago and some editor features have changed, but they are still worth reading!

## Sharing and Contributing

### License
A number of tutorial resources have been written for the SCS game engine map editor, but it's been difficult to build upon these efforts due to their lack of license, or restrictive license.

**Attribution** is a requirement of the license wherever you redistribute or modify the guide, a link back to this repo AND the original [github repo](https://github.com/SCSModdingGuide/mappingguide) will suffice.  This version is a fork of that original repo:  the original author no longer wishes to maintain&update, so the torch has been passed.
