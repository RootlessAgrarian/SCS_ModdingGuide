# Basic Editor Setup



## Folder Terminology

This guide will refer to two folders used by ETS2/ATS. We'll be calling them the __user__ folder and the __executable__ folder.

The *user* folder is the game folder located in the *Documents* directory on Windows platforms. This folder contains the *mod* folder, where we'll place our created maps.

```powershell
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\American Truck Simulator
```

The *executable* folder is the game's main folder, which in it contains the game files and executables. Maps we create will be saved in a subfolder here

```powershell
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\American Truck Simulator
```
