# Keyboard short cuts and mouse actions

As you've seen by now, there is a lot of repetitive selection of tools and of menu items in the map editing process.  Why not make life easier and use some of the handy built-in shortcuts?  Here's a list of things you can do with keyboard and mouse.

Action | Result
------------ | -------------
Right Click/Drag | move the map
Left Click/Drag | select / extend selection / move a selected object
SHIFT Click | disconnect connected nodes
Mouse Hover over node | remembers node height and uses it for next object placement?
Page Up | fast - zoom.
Page Down | fast + zoom.
Scroll up (on the mouse wheel) | slow + zoom.
Scroll down (on the mouse wheel) | slow - zoom.

To the right of the editor menu are lists you can select from, but it is easier to use shortcut keys, a list of which 
follows (Standard Qwerty, in brackets Azerty Keyboard)

Key | Action
------------ | -------------
A (Q) | toggle background map on or off. If you don’t have any, you will see some red text.
B | Use the brush tool (use sparingly if at all)
C | Camera view (changes from overhead (editor) view to on the “fly” (roadside view) very useful tool to enable you to see how your roads will look in the map and to aid with changing the height of an item
D | Delete item by selecting the red node.
E | New item
F | Find
G | Add sign tool
H | Height tool
I | Import item
M (,) | Move item
N | Node properties
P | Item properties
Q | Put the background map
R | Rotate item on X, Y or Z
S | Place Start (the car)
KP -, KP + | Rotate the start car
SPACE | switch to editor mode (visible handles) in flycam view

1 | Road
2 | Prefab
3 | Building
4 | Model
5 | Company
6 | Services point (allows you to add custom services and refueling points)
7 | Cut plane (creates a zone that the engine doesn’t need to load at startup but will load when you approach the zone (not really used))
8 | Mover (such as hot air balloon, wind turbine, windmill and so on)
9 | City (This is the option used to add city entities to your map)
F5 | toggle mini-map.
