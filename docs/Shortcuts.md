Keyboard short cuts and mouse actions:

Right Click = move the map
Left Click = select or move a selected object
Page Up => fast - zoom.
Page Down => fast + zoom.
Scroll up (on the mouse wheel) => slow + zoom.
Scroll down (on the mouse wheel) => slow - zoom.

To the right of the editor menu are lists you can select from but it is easier to use shortcut keys, a list of which 
follows (Standard Qwerty, in brackets Azerty Keyboard)

A (Q) = toggle background map on or off. If you don’t have any, it will put a red font.
B = Use the brush tool (use sparingly if at all)
C= Camera view (changes from overhead (editor) view to on the “fly” (roadside view) very useful tool to enable you to see how your roads will look in the map and to aid with changing the height of an item
D= Delete item by selecting the red node.
E= New item
F= Find
G=Add sign tool
H= Height tool
I= Import item
M (,) = Move item
N= Node properties

4= Model
5= Company
6= Services point (allows you to add custom services and refueling points)
7= Cut plane (creates a zone that the engine doesn’t need to load at startup but will load when you approach the zone (not really used))

9= City (This is the option used to add city entities to your map)
